For this use module random and create following lists: when, who, name, residence, went, happened.
Fill these lists with various options according to the topic and then print in the end your storyüòÅ 

Here is an example of mine:
"On a rainy afternoon, a clumsy dragon named Lady Whiskers that lived in a floating island,
went to the a chocolate factory and invented a new dance move."
